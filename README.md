# 🖍️ ColorWiz: An AI Powered Coloring Book Generator
This is a group capstone project that was done for the completion of a bachelors degree in Information Technology.

# 🌟 Features
* **User-friendly GUI:** easy-to-use and simple graphical user interface built with Tkinter, enhancing the user experience.
* **Image Generation:** Leverages the power of the OpenAI DALL·E model to generate diverse and creative images based on user-defined style prompts.
* **Fun Fact Generation:** Leverages the power of the OpenAI GPT3 model to generate fun facts based on user-defined subject matter prompts.
* **PDF Creation:** Automatically converts the generated images into individual PDF files, enabling users to organize and share them efficiently.
* **PDF Merging:** Provides functionality to merge individual PDFs into a cohesive document, simplifying the management of multiple images.

# 🚀 Getting Started
1. Download the code.
2. Install below dependencies.
3. Set Up an OpenAI API Key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and replace the placeholder `?` in the code with your actual API key.
4. Run the application and interact with the GUI.

## 🔧 Requirements
* **Python:** ColorWiz requires [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure that you have the necessary Python packages and dependencies installed.
* **Tkinter:** Install custom Tkinter with `pip install customtkinter`.
* **Requests:** Install with `pip install requests`.
* **Pillow (PIL):** Install with `pip install pillow`.
* **OpenAI API Key:** Obtain and install the OpenAI API key with `pip install openai`.
* **PyPDF2:** Install with `pip install PyPDF2`.
* **ReportLab:** Install with `pip install reportlab`.
* **Packaging:** Install with `pip install packaging`.
* **Nuitka:** Install with `python -m pip install nuitka`.
    * Once the Code is ready, nuitka can be used to create an executable. You will have to navigate where the python script is stored through a terminal or command line and type python -m nuitka --mingw64 filename.py

## ⚙️ API Configuration
* **Create OpenAI Account:** If you don't have an OpenAI account, start by signing up on the OpenAI website and log in.
* **API Key Creation:** In the Developer Dashboard, navigate to the "API Keys" section. Here, you'll find options for creating and managing your API keys.
* **Create a New API Key:** Click on the "Create API Key" or a similar button to initiate the key creation process.
* **Select DALL-E and GPT3 Access:** DALL-E and GPT3 use the same API. Ensure that you select them as the API service you want to access with this key.
* **Create the Key:** After configuring the key settings and accepting the terms, click the "Create" or "Generate" button to create your API key.
* **API Key Retrieval:** Your new API key will be generated, and you'll be provided with the key string. Make sure to keep this key secure.

## 📝 Description Crafting
